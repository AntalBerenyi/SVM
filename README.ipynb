    "## Overview\n",
    "This project is based on the original work: \"Building Predictive Models for Mechanism-of-Action Classification from Phenotypic Assay Data Sets\". The aim is to get a basic working idea of what's going on and get a working model. It is NOT intended to exactly replicate what the original work was doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [original work](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087057113505324) built a predictive model for assigning mechanism class to compounds and bioactive agents. The model used 84 features and 309 environmental chemicals. The mechanism classes can used to evaluate the safety, efficacy and toxicity of compounds.\n",

    "The main notebook is [MAIN - SVM.ipynb](Notebooks/MAIN%20-%20SVM.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisities\n",
    "You will be running the SVM Tool in a Jupyter notebook in a pre-configured computing environment. The best way to get Jupiter and to manage your environment is via Anaconda. Think of Anaconda and the \"App Store\" of everything Python. You will need to do this step only once. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended at least 8GB memory and 1 GB available disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 0. Browser\n",
    "You need a modern-day browser such as Google Chrome, or Firefox. Try to avoid MS Explorer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2. Install Anaconda\n",
    "1. Go to the official Anaconda web site https://www.anaconda.com/download/, and download the Pyhton 3.6 (or greater) version.\n",
    "1. Follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "1. Launch the application to verify installation. You can click the `Launch` button under the Jupyter notebook icon to start up your notebook.  \n",
    "1. Congratulations, you have installed Anaconda and Jupyter!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3. Configure Anaconda environment\n",
    "1. Start up Anaconda, and once it is running, click on the Environment tab.\n",
    "1. Click `Import` near the bottom of the window.\n",
    "1. Navigate to and choose the  file named `envPy36_Windows.yml` file in the folder you downloaded.\n",
    "1. Click \"Import\". Anaconda now dowloads all necessary files. This may take a few minutes but be patient.\n",
    "1. Congratulations! You have configured your environment to run svm. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Launch Jupyter notebook and SVM tool\n",
    "1. On the Ananconda home page, select the environment `py36` you have imported in the Prerequisites.\n",
    "1. Click the `Launch` button.\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Launch.PNG\"></img>\n",
    "1. A new browser window will pop up showing the Jupyter dashboard page.\n",

    "## FAQ\n",
    "### Q: What is Python?\n",
    "It is the language this software is written in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What is Jupiter notebook?\n",
    "It is the name for both the document and the tool rendering the document. A notebook document is a combination of descriptive text, figures data and computations to aid reproducible research. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What is Anaconda?\n",
    "It is the \"App Store\" for everything Python and scikit-learn related tools. If you are a newcomer to Jupyter it is the best way to install Anaconda first to get Jupyter and other tools. You only need to install Anaconda once. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What's the best way to get up-and-running with Jupyter?\n",
    "Jupyter has an intuitive, built-in walk-through tutorial to get you started. Once you have Jupyter running, go to the Help menu and click \"User Interface Tour\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Can I try it before installing it?\n",
    "Yes. Go to https://jupyter.org/try and click 'Try Jupyter with Python\". This will take you to a runnig notebook where you can follow the link to [Notebook Basics](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-qxyctyux/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: Where can I learn more about Python/Jupyter/Anaconda?\n",
    "In order to use the tool you only need minimal understanding of Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q: What libraries are used in svm project?\n",
    "Numpy, Pandas and scikit-learn. They are a collection of very useful libraries for scientific computation. Read more [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",

    "## How to\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to list Notebook servers running\n",
    "1. Open up the Command Prompt. Note that the \"me\" in the prompt will be your user name.\n",
    "2. Type at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\me>jupyter notebook list\n",
    "Currently running servers:\n",
    "http://localhost:8889/?token=b7d853d39486759cf2a76f28e77657d5744c9364936cd2b7 :: C:\\Users\\me\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to stop a notebook server\n",
    "To terminate a notebook server on a particular port, do the following:\n",
    "1. Take note which port jupyter is running on. In the example above it is port 8888\n",
    "2. To stop the notebook type at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\me>jupyter notebook stop 8888\n",
    "Shutting down server on port 8888 ...`\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to stop a notebook server that cannot be stopped\n",
    "Sometimes the server process cannot be stopped and you get an error message when trying to stop it. That case you need to force-stop it:\n",
    "1. Type at the prompt the following, replacing the port number 8888 with the actual port number of the misbehaving Notebook server:\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\me>netstat -nao | find \"8888\"\n",
    "TCP    127.0.0.1:8888         0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       6992'`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the output take note of the last number, the so-called PID, 6992. It will be different in your case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To force-kill this process type at the prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Users\\me>Taskkill /PID 6992 /F'`\n"
