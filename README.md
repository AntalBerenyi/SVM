# SVM
SVM project

Overview
This notebook is based on the original work: "Building Predictive Models for Mechanism-of-Action Classification from Phenotypic Assay Data Sets". The aim is to get a basic working idea of what's going on and get a working model. It is NOT intended to exactly replicate what the original work was doing.

The [original work](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087057113505324) built a predictive model for assigning mechanism class to compounds and bioactive agents. The model used 84 features and 309 environmental chemicals. The mechanism classes can used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of compounds and include classes such as inhibitors of mitochondrial and microtubule function, etc.

The main notebook is [MAIN - SVM.ipynb](Notebooks/MAIN%20-%20SVM.ipynb)



## Prerequisities
You will be running the SVM in a Jupyter notebook in a pre-configured computing environment. The best way to get Jupiter and to manage your environment is via Anaconda. Think of Anaconda and the "App Store" of everything Python. You will need to do this step only once. 

### Step 0
You need a modern-day browser such as Google Chrome, or Firefox. Try to avoid MS Explorer.

### Step 2. Install Anaconda
1. Go to the official Anaconda web site https://www.anaconda.com/download/, and download the Pyhton 3.6 version.
2. Follow the installation instructions.
3. Congratulations, you have installed Anaconda and Jupyter!

## FAQ
### Q: What is Python?
It is the language this software is written in.

### Q: What it scikit-learn?
A collection of very useful libraries for scientific computation

### Q: What is Jupiter notebook?
It is the name for both the document and the tool rendering the document. A notebook document is a combination of descriptive text, figures data and computations to aid reproducible research. 

### Q: What's the best way to get up-and-running with Jupyter?
Jupyter has an intuitive, built-in walk-through tutorial to get you started. Once you have Jupyter running, go to the Help menu and click "User Interface Tour".  

### Q: Can I try it before installing it?
Yes. Go to https://jupyter.org/try and click 'Try Jupyter with Python". This will take you to a runnig notebook where you can follow the link to [Notebook Basics](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/ipython-ipython-in-depth-qxyctyux/notebooks/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb).

### Q: What is Anaconda?
It is the "App Store" for everything Python and scikit-learn related tools. If you are a newcomer to Jupyter it is the best way to install Anaconda first to get Jupyter and other tools. You only need to install Anaconda once. https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/

### Q: Where can I learn more about Python/Jupyter/Anaconda?
In order to use the tool you only need minimal understanding of Jupyter Notebook.
