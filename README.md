Overview
This notebook is based on the original work: "Building Predictive Models for Mechanism-of-Action Classification from Phenotypic Assay Data Sets". The aim is to get a basic working idea of what's going on and get a working model. It is NOT intended to exactly replicate what the original work was doing.

The [original work](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087057113505324) built a predictive model for assigning mechanism class to compounds and bioactive agents. The model used 84 features and 309 environmental chemicals. The mechanism classes can used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of compounds and include classes such as inhibitors of mitochondrial and microtubule function, etc.
