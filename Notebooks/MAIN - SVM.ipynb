    "# SVM Model for Mechanism Prediction - Evaluation & Validation\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the original work: \"Building Predictive Models for Mechanism-of-Action Classification from Phenotypic Assay Data Sets\". The aim is to get a basic working idea of what's going on and get a working model. It is NOT intended to exactly replicate what the original work was doing but rather to achieve similar or better performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [original work](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087057113505324) built a predictive model for assigning mechanism class to compounds and to bioactive agents. The model used 84 features and 309 environmental chemicals. Knowing the mechanism class of chemicals can then be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of compounds and include classes such as inhibitors of mitochondrial and microtubule function, etc.\n",
