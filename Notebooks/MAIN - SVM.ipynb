    "# SVM Model for Mechanism Prediction - Evaluation & Validation\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is based on the original work: \"Building Predictive Models for Mechanism-of-Action Classification from Phenotypic Assay Data Sets\". The aim is to get a basic working idea of what's going on and get a working model. It is NOT intended to exactly replicate what the original work was doing but rather to achieve similar or better performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [original work](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1087057113505324) built a predictive model for assigning mechanism class to compounds and to bioactive agents. The model used 84 features and 309 environmental chemicals. Knowing the mechanism class of chemicals can then be used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of compounds and include classes such as inhibitors of mitochondrial and microtubule function, etc.\n",

    "Each feature in the data set is a biomarker readout. The features are labeled as System:Readout. The set of Readouts together make up Compound Profiles that are generated by measuring changes in the levels of a set (8â€“12) of biomarkers (proteins, mediators, known disease risk factors, etc.) in each System. These features indicate a response of a cell type (System) to a certain drug by making more or less of each type of Readout measured. \n",
    "We hope that the response of a cell to a drug class manifests itself in the pattern it exhibits in the profile. The profile is a vector of continuous value that represents a point in 84 dimensional space, each readout being a dimension. The values are themselves the logarithm of an n-fold increase or decrease in a expression levels of biomarkers. Their range is typically -2 to + 2.\n",
